# [109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/convert-sorted-list-to-binary-search-tree)
 ### Description
<p>Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.</p>

<p>For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of <em>every</em> node never differ by more than 1.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<pre>
Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],

One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:

      0
     / \
   -3   9
   /   /
 -10  5
</pre>
